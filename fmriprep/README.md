To run fmriprep simply go to this directory and write *sh fmriprep.sh* in the terminal on the greene cluster. It will look inside the derivatives/fmriprep directory
and initiate fmriprep for subjects that have not been processed. Once executed it will disply a message
"submitted fmriprep for subject XXX"
